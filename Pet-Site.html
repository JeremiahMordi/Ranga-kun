    <h1>Yo.. It's your boy J.Miah here again</h1>
    <h2>It feels good to be back here.</h2>

    <p>Today, I'll be discussing my little friend Ranga. Yes. He's named after Ranga from Tensura.</p>
    <p>Ranga is my pet dog, well more of a pup at the moment. and he's the cutest thing ever. Ranga is a Siberian Husky by breed and is currently a little bit more than a few months old.</p>
    <p>He is an all white and has this pair of striking blue eyes. at times, there's a way he staes at me and i feel like he's seeing right into my soul. Weird right?</p>
