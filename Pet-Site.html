    <h1>Yo.. It's your boy J.Miah here again...</h1>
    <h2>It feels good to be back here.</h2>

    <p>Today, I'll be discussing my little friend Ranga. Yes. He's named after Ranga from Tensura.</p>
    <p>Ranga is my pet dog, well more of a pup at the moment. and he's the cutest thing ever. Ranga is a Siberian Husky by breed and is currently a little bit more than a few months old.</p>
    <p>He is an all white and has this pair of striking blue eyes. at times, there's a way he stares at me and I feel like he's seeing right into my soul. Weird right?</p>
    <p>Ranga is also very mischievious and dramatic and can be very rascally. One time, he swiped some frosting off the ice cream cake for my birthday. And ran away when he saw me coming. He later came by with his big glowing eyes, begging after I made him know I wasnt happy. On tht note, Ranga is a very smart pup. Sometimes, a bit too smart.</p>
    
    <p>Here's a pic showing what the little rascal looks like.</p>
